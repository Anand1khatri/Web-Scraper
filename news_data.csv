Pakistan,Dawn,"At trilateral summit with Turkish and Azeri presidents, PM Shehbaz  rejects conflict ",2025-05-28 16:53:34,"<p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said he, along with the presidents of Turkiye and Azerbaijan, had gathered at a trilateral summit to  reject conflict .</p> <p>The prime minister participated in the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit alongside presidents Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Ilham Aliyev. The meeting comes as the premier continued his <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1913237"">tour to friendly countries</a> to appreciate their support for Pakistan during the <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out"">recent conflict</a> with India.</p> <p>Speaking at the summit, PM Shehbaz said:  The world we live in faces numerous grave challenges, including armed conflict, climate change, diseases and economic crises.</p> <p> This is why the three of us have assembled here today, opting for compassion while rejecting conflict. We are confident that patience and wisdom will ultimately usher in peace and prosperity. </p> <p> <figure class=""media w-full w-full media--stretch media--embed ""> <div class=""media__item media__item--youtube ""></div> </figure></p> <p> I have said in all humility that we want peace in the region. [ ] and that requires talks on the table on issues which need urgent attention and amicable resolution, i.e. the issue of Kashmir according to the resolutions of the United Nations and the Security Council and as per the aspirations of the people of Kashmir. </p> <p>On India s unilateral move to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance, the premier said:  India tried to weaponise the Indus Waters Treaty, which is a lifeline for the people of Pakistan   240 million people   for their agricultural use, for drinking and many other purposes.</p> <p> I think this is most unfortunate that India tried to threaten to stop our flow of water to Pakistan. This is not possible, was never possible, and will not be possible, God-willing. We are making proper arrangements to ensure that India never ever does it,  he asserted.</p> <p> I have said in all earnest that if India wants to talk on countering terrorism in sincerity of purpose, Pakistan would be willing to talk to India on this issue as well. But this is a fact of life that we are the biggest victims of terrorism around the globe; we lost 90,000 valuable lives in Pakistan and $150 billion worth of economic losses over the last many decades.</p> <p> There cannot be a bigger commitment and intention to beat this menace for all times to come, and in that, if India wants in all sincerity honest cooperation, Pakistan would be willing, along with the promotion of trade with India. All these issues need to be discussed on the table. </p> <p> I would be extremely grateful for your support in this regard,  he said, addressing the Turkiye and Azerbaijan presidents.</p> <p> In today s unpredictable and volatile world, political security, architectures, connectivity, alignments and emerging technologies are shaping the new reality. In such a situation, Pakistan is very fortunate to have sincere brothers like Turkiye and Azerbaijan who have stood together with us as impregnable rocks and whom we can trust without a second thought. </p> <p>Reiterating his gratitude to Erdogan and Aliyev for their diplomatic support during the recent conflict with India, which  was obviously very serious .  It was an aggression from India against Pakistan for no rhyme and reason. </p> <p>He noted Erdogan s  firm stand and solidarity with the people of Pakistan , as well as Aliyev s unwavering commitment to the people of Pakistan  had earned the highest level of appreciation from his government and the nation.</p> <p>The prime minister hailed the role of Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir during Pakistan s response, noting the  great bravery and the highest level of professional acumen  of the armed forces under his leadership.</p> <p> I saw him during those moments God-fearing, fearless, firm and with an iron resolve, with patience and obviously with fortitude to face that aggression. </p> <p>Addressing Aliyev, the premier thanked him for the hospitality shown to him and his delegation, noting that today s summit  reflects the meeting of hearts and souls of genuine friends and sincere well-wishers .</p> <p>Recalling the  most fruitful discussions  at the <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1843759"">Shanghai Cooperation Organisation</a> summit last year in Kazakhstan, PM Shehbaz said,  We are now eagerly looking forward to taking our trilateral partnership to new heights that would be in consonance with the wishes and desires of our people.</p> <p> This would be no surprise to anyone as Pakistan, Azerbaijan and Turkiye are bound together by deep historical, cultural and spiritual ties forged through centuries of shared values and mutual support,  he asserted.</p> <p> This historical relationship has been further strengthened as we have stood by each other, whether it be on Karabakh, Kashmir or northern Turkish Cyprus. Our strength lies in our solidarity and mutual respect. </p> <p>Noting the  outpouring of love and affection in both Turkiye and Azerbaijan  for Pakistan, PM Shehbaz noted:  We could not but be mesmerised by the intensity of the fervour and enthusiasm of our common citizens during Pakistan s recent conflict with India. </p> <p>He noted that India  not only failed to bring any credible evidence against Pakistan but also rejected our sincere and generous offer of a neutral, transparent investigation into the so-called incident in Pahalgam by any international body .</p> <p>At the outset of his speech, the premier congratulated Aliyev and the Azerbaijani nation on their Republic Day.  The way the Azeri nation fought for its liberation, you earned a high position in the community of nations. </p> <p>He also felicitated the Turkish president for  very skillfully resolving the issue  of the PKK, referring to the Kurdish rebels  recent <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1910519"">decision to disband</a>.  That goes to explain in volumes, my brother, your diplomatic skills to resolve this issue, and by virtue of this, you have earned a high place and influence not only in the region, but beyond. </p> <p>Addressing the summit first, President Aliyev said:  The recent tensions between Pakistan and India had troubled us the most and we watched it very closely in the hope that peace would prevail, and from the early hours we have <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1911194/azerbaijan-hails-pakistans-remarkable-success-during-recent-military-strife-with-india-pmo"">expressed our solidarity</a> with brotherly Pakistan.</p> <p> We would like to see dialogue and negotiations in line with the UN Charter and resolutions; this is the way to move forward in this conflict. </p> <p> <figure class=""media sm:w-full w-full media--stretch ""> <div class=""media__item ""><img alt="" President Ilham Aliyev attends the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan on May 28, 2025. &mdash; X/azpresident "" src=""https://i.dawn.com/primary/2025/05/281630469de45d2.jpg"" /></div> <figcaption class=""media__caption "">President Ilham Aliyev attends the Pakistan-Turkiye-Azerbaijan Trilateral Summit in Lachin, Azerbaijan on May 28, 2025.

of May 18</a>, a total of 55,865 Afghan nationals including 35,975 ACC holders and 19,890 illegal migrants have left for Afghanistan since April 1, the day the second phase began after the deadline for <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1785519/govt-initiates-nationwide-operation-to-deport-illegal-foreign-nationals"">repatriation</a> of registered Afghan nationals ended on <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1896556"">March 31</a>.</p> <p>The PEN International-led joint statement, signed by freedom of expression and human rights organisations, concerns the recent acceleration in the mass deportation of Afghans from Pakistan, including at-risk writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders and others at risk of persecution from the Taliban for their peaceful expression.</p> <p> <figure class=""media sm:w-1/2 w-full media--right media--embed media--uneven""> <div class=""media__item media__item--newskitlink ""> </div> </figure></p> <p>More than a dozen organisations called on the government to  immediately halt the arbitrary mass deportation of Afghan nationals in line with the country s human rights obligations, including the principle of non-refoulement.</p> <p> We urge the international community to continue to provide safety to at-risk Afghans, including writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders and others who fled the Taliban s persecution,  PEN International said.</p> <p>It noted that the government s decision to deport Afghan nationals, announced on <a

3, 2023</a>, drew  significant concern  from international institutions, including the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration, who urged the government to continue to protect at-risk Afghans.</p> <p> Despite the UNHCR s active non-return advisory for Afghanistan and calls from UN experts to halt the deportations, the government of Pakistan has accelerated its forced returns in recent months, resulting in over 30,000 deportations in April alone,  the statement said.</p> <p> Included among those deported who are at greatest risk of persecution are writers, journalists, artists, and human rights defenders who continue to face significant threats of arbitrary arrest, torture and imprisonment for any form of expression that the Taliban deem incompatible with their ideology.</p> <p> Women and girls deported to Afghanistan will face overwhelming levels of repression impacting every aspect of their lives, amounting to what UN experts have described as  gender apartheid ,  the statement read.</p> <p>Many of those who fled across the border into Pakistan following the Taliban s return to de facto rule in August 2021 had planned to travel onwards to a country of safety, PEN International stated</p> <p> However, the <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home"">suspension of humanitarian visa</a> pathways and inadequate support for at-risk Afghans in countries around the world, including the US, the UK and Germany, has left many stranded in a situation of abject precarity and insecurity. </p> <p>For the over one million Afghan refugees and asylum seekers who remain in Pakistan, the intensifying crackdown by Pakistani authorities, which includes mass arrests and other forms of harassment, has instilled a renewed sense of fear in a community already blighted by conflict and marginalisation, PEN International emphasised.</p> <p> In light of the severe risk posed by the Taliban, the undersigned organisations call on the government of Pakistan to immediately suspend its  Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan .</p> <p> We also call on the international community to ensure safe and legal passage for Afghan refugees and asylum seekers, including writers, journalists, artists, human rights defenders, and others at risk of persecution for their peaceful expression.</p> <p>The organisations who

It continued that  India s youth, often the first casualty of chauvinistic nationalism, would do well to reject the politics of fear and instead work toward a future defined by dignity, reason, and regional cooperation .</p> <p>The statement read that such acts may serve domestic optics but cannot withstand international scrutiny or inspire India s image as a responsible regional power, while highlighting that  the ideological followers of India s current government have normalised mob violence, promoted hate campaigns and targeted religious minorities .</p> <p> The Indian government is linked to extraterritorial assassinations and foreign subversion.</p> <p>India is in occupation of foreign people and territories. Its record in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir is defined by systematic repression. It is ironic that such a state now attempts to claim the mantle of victimhood. </p>",https://www.dawn.com/news/1913855/pakistan-slams-modis-inflammatory-monologue-urges-india-to-honour-international-order,en

We must move with urgency and coordination to create a payments environment that is inclusive, interoperable, and focused on ease of use for every Pakistani citizen,  he said.</p> <p><strong>Engagements with industry</strong></p> <p>In a meeting with a delegation of the All Pakistan Ceramic Tiles Manufacturers Association (APCTMA) and Pakistan Association of Large Steel Producers (PALSA), Mr Aurangzeb said the government was committed to shifting the tax burden away from the already compliant formal sector and the salaried class towards segments of the economy that have so far remained undocumented or under-taxed.</p> <p>The prime minister is personally leading high-level meetings to drive forward reforms that enhance transparency, documentation and economic equity across all, he said, adding that broadening the tax base is essential to achieving fiscal balance and promoting fairness in the economy.</p> <p>The <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1501536"">ceramic tiles manufacturers</a> reported the manufacturing capacity at about 560,000 square metres per day, backed by over Rs100 billion in investments, nearly 60 per cent of which is foreign direct investment from China.

They also highlighted the impact of taxation policies on formal businesses and sought government support to level the playing field.</p> <p>The finance minister promised to resolve these challenges and reiterated that every sector must play its role in stabilising and growing the economy.</p> <p> We cannot allow the burden to fall solely on the formal sector and the salaried class,  he was quoted as saying, adding that the government was pursuing a broad-based strategy to expand the tax base, reduce reliance on over-taxed segments and bring the undocumented economy into the fold.</p> <p><em>Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025</em></p>",https://www.dawn.com/news/1913808/government-plans-curbs-incentives-to-push-cashless-economy,en

Pakistan,Dawn,Consumers to bear burden as K-Electric allowed to build recovery losses into tariff,2025-05-28 09:22:32,"<p>ISLAMABAD: In a major policy departure, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Tuesday approved K-Electric s request to incorporate unrecovered bills into its consumer tariff   starting with a recovery shortfall of 6.75 per cent in 2023-24, gradually declining to 3.5pc by 2029-30.</p> <p>Nepra set K-Electric s base tariff at Rs40 per unit for the fiscal year 2023-24, which is almost 40pc higher than even the national average tariff of about Rs28 per unit in 2025-26 for the 10 public sector power distribution companies (Discos).</p> <p>The delta between the Discos  average and K-Electric s tariff is transferred to the taxpayers through the federal budget in the form of tariff differential subsidy.</p> <p>In a detailed determination, the regulator changed K-Electric s tariff mechanism based on 100pc recovery of bills and instead allowed recovery losses in the tariff, starting from 6.75pc in FY24 and gradually declining to 3.5pc by F30.</p> <blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1""> <p>Nepra sets utility s base rate at Rs40 per unit, 40pc higher than national average tariff</p> </blockquote> <p>Interestingly, the Discos  tariff is still based on a 100pc recovery of bills. The judgement on K-Electric indicated that a similar charge may be coming up for Discos  tariff in the shape of higher costs to honest consumers.</p> <p> <figure class=""media sm:w-1/2 w-full media--right media--embed media--uneven""> <div class=""media__item media__item--newskitlink ""> </div> </figure></p> <p> To ensure sufficient liquidity in the power market and to align the collection targets with current market realities, the authority has decided to allow recovery loss to K-Electric,  Nepra said, directing K-Electric to ensure collection of 93.35pc of FY24 billing, 93.6pc in FY25, 94.4pc in FY26, 95.19pc in FY27, 95.7pc in FY28, 96.10pc in FY29, and 96.5pc in FY30.</p> <p>The loss recovery allowance, starting at 93.25pc, was opposed by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division). Although it supported the loss recovery allowance through tariff, apparently to claim similar dispensation for government-owned Discos, it said a lower recovery ratio should be allowed, starting with 96.7pc, and an increase in commercial losses should be benchmarked against efficient Discos to arrive at reasonable targets.</p> <p>Nepra set the total average tariff at Rs39.97 per unit for FY24, which included a power purchase cost of Rs31.96, transmission cost of Rs2.86, distribution cost of Rs3.31, and supply margin of Rs2.28, with a negative prior-year adjustment of 44 paise per unit to ensure total revenue requirement of Rs606 billion.</p> <p>Interestingly, the above tariff is based on almost half of the power supply from the national grid; otherwise, K-Electric s average base rate would have been much higher.</p> <p>This determination covers a total power dispatch of 17,768 gigawatt-hours (GWh)   48pc sourced from the national grid, 42pc from K-Electric s own generation, and 9.9pc from private suppliers.</p> <p>K-Electric s total revenue requirement determined by Nepra at Rs606.92bn for FY24 included a supply margin Rs34.68bn, operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) allowance at Rs5.91bn, negative working capital adjustment of Rs1.244bn, recovery loss of Rs36.25bn, gross margin of Rs40.92bn, and net margin of Rs34.68bn after a negative prior-year adjustment of Rs6.69bn.</p> <p>The power regulator noted that K-Electric s previous multi-year tariff (MYT) for 2017-23 did not allow any provision on account of recovery loss. Instead, actual write-offs were allowed subject to prescribed criteria.</p> <p>Considering that FY24 had already lapsed and FY25 was almost 10 months gone, K-Electric s actual recovery for FY24 remained at 91.5pc, whereas FY25 was expected to close at 90.5pc, it said. The financial impact of these under-recoveries was around Rs40bn and Rs57bn, respectively.</p> <p> The authority noted that return allowed to K-Electric for its distribution function is around Rs21.6bn, meaning thereby that effectively K-Electric would be incurring losses for the first two years of MYT, if no recovery loss is allowed to K-Electric. This may compromise the financial viability of the company, which is neither in the interest of the consumers nor power system as whole,  Nepra said.</p> <p>The regulator said that Discos were not allowed any recovery loss, but the federal government had the power to levy surcharges to offset the inefficiencies of Discos arising from high losses and under-recoveries. However, no such option is available for K-Electric, as it can only charge the regulated tariff.</p> <p>It said the National Electricity Policy 2021 empowered Nepra to revisit the target for collections and align with the current market realities through  efficient tariff structures for sufficient liquidity in the power market  as  international precedents also suggest that 100pc billing recovery is generally not mandated .</p> <p><strong>Solar projects</strong></p> <p>In a separate development, Nepra approved bidding results of K-Electric s two solar-powered plants with a combined capacity of 150 megawatts, promising the lowest-ever rates in Pakistan.</p> <p>Under the determination, Master Textile Mills Limited has been declared the lowest bidder at the lowest offered tariff of Rs11.6508 (4.0363 US cents) per kilowatt-hour for the 50MW Winder project, and Rs11.21 (3.8826 US cents) per kWh for the 100MW Bela project.</p> <p>The two projects are estimated to bring savings, both in terms of cost and forex outflow, in both national and K-Electric s grids, by displacing the existing expensive generation, Nepra said.</p> <p>It added that energy cost savings due to fuel displacement were estimated at Rs2.3bn annually, amounting to a total of Rs57.8bn over the life of the projects. Additionally, the projects are estimated to generate annual foreign exchange savings of $17.01 million, totalling $425.2m in savings over their lifespan.</p> <p><em>Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025</em></p>",https://www.dawn.com/news/1913826/consumers-to-bear-burden-as-k-electric-allowed-to-build-recovery-losses-into-tariff,en

If these members are independent, then the role of SIC is still intact here,  Justice Mazhar remarked.</p> <p>Another bench member, Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, asked about the  understanding  between PTI and questioned Mr Siddiqi whether the members he was representing belonged to PTI or SIC.</p> <p>Justice Hilali asked about the symbol on which Sahibzada Hamid Raza, the SIC chairman, contested the elections. She added that Mr Raza himself contested the February 2024 general election as an independent candidate.</p> <p> Why did Hamid Raza not contest the election from the platform of SIC?  Justice Hilali asked and expressed her annoyance at Mr Siddiqi for agreeing to answer the questions but later avoiding them.</p> <p> What was the philosophy behind SIC members contesting elections as independents?  she wondered.</p> <p>The counsel explained the lawmakers were not candidates of SIC, but rather independent and the majority judgement classified them as such. Later, they were candidates of the PTI and not independent.</p> <p>Mr Siddiqi said the court can grant three types of relief   set aside the majority judgement, the consequence of which would be that the Peshawar High Court judgement and the ECP s decision will be revived. The second being substituting the majority judgement with the minority and the third being the majority judgement set aside and the appeals before PHC revived for re-hearing.</p> <p>Justice Khan observed that whatever record the majority judgment had relied upon was  not admissible  evidence as per the law.  No one knows which nomination papers   out of four   of these independent candidates were submitted by the ECP during the hearing.  </p> <p>He reminded the minority jud gment, which he and Justice Nae em Akhtar Afghan had authored, did not rely on these records since they were not admitted as evidence.</p> <p> Therefore, these were not part of the record of the case. </p> <p>Justice Mandokhail remarked that it should be left to the court to consider whether the right of any party was being infringed upon or not.</p> <p>Later, the case was adjourned till Thursday.</p> <p><em>Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025</em></p>",https://www.dawn.com/news/1913802/judges-in-a-fix-over-sic-role-in-reserved-seats-case,en

He said the then chief justice of the IHC Aamir Farooq was completely independent in determining their seniority while deciding the representation of five IHC judges.</p> <p>At this, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, who was heading the constitutional bench, observed that the counsel representing the petitioner judges did not apprise the court about the representation moved by the judges the high court and its decision. The attorney general explained that the IHC judges had requested for determination of seniority upon taking the oath.</p> <blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1""> <p>Justice Aamir had complete independence in determining IHC judges  seniority while deciding their representation, SC told</p> </blockquote> <p>Also, Justice Shakeel Ahmed observed that none of the counsel earlier mentioned the representation and subsequent decision by the then CJ of the high court.</p> <p>The AGP said <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1912990"">Article 200</a> of the Constitution explained the method of transfer of the judges, whereas the power of veto to question any such transfer was with the judiciary and not with the executive. At the time of transfer, all the chief justices had expressed their willingness over the transfer, he added.</p> <p>But Justice Salahuddin Panwhar observed that an opinion of chief justice on the issue of seniority was never sought.</p> <p>During the hearing, the bench raised questions whether the authority of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) could be made ineffective by transferring judges on a permanent basis, also asking about any principles for judges  transfer.</p> <p>Mr Awar reminded the court that Article 200 could not be made ineffective. Even when the <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1471887"">18th Amendment</a> was made, Article 200 was not changed, he said. The AGP further said, in his opinion, setting a time for transferred judges was like adding new words to the Constitution.</p> <p>When Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan said that the minutes of JCP meeting held on Feb 10 should be provided, the AGP explained that two additional judges were <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1886607/two-new-ihc-judges-take-oath"">appointed</a> to the IHC in Jan 17 meeting of the commission whereas in the subsequent JCP meeting held on Feb 10, IHC CJ Aamir Farooq was elevated to the Supreme Court.</p> <p>Justice Afghan asked if acting IHC CJ Sardar Sarfaraz Dogar, too, was among those on the list to be considered for elevation by the JCP on Feb 10, the AGP replied in affirmative.</p> <p>The AGP requested the court to reject petitions of the PTI founder and others by declaring them as inadmissible.

British police believe the incident, in a packed Liverpool city centre on Monday, was isolated and not an act of terrorism.</p> <p>They said the driver of the grey Ford Galaxy people-carrier involved in the incident was believed to have followed an ambulance into a closed street when a road block was lifted to allow paramedics to attend to a suspected heart attack victim.</p> <p>Videos posted online showed the vehicle driving through the street crowded with fans, sending several flying into the air and dragging at least four under its wheels.</p> <blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1""> <p>Police identified the driver as  53-year-old white British man to cool social media speculation </p> </blockquote> <p>When the vehicle stopped, angry people converged on it and began smashing the windows as police officers battled to prevent them from reaching the driver. Police said 50 people, including children, had been treated for their injuries, with 11 still in hospital.</p> <p> They are all in a stable condition, and I am pleased to say that they appear to be recovering well,  Deputy Chief Constable Jenny Sims said.</p> <p>King Charles, who is visiting Canada, said he was  deeply shocked and saddened to hear of the terrible events . His sister, Princess Anne, met medics who had treated some of the injured at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital.</p> <p><strong>Million people</strong></p> <p>With most people off work for the Spring Bank Holiday, officials estimated that around 1 million people descended on the 10-mile (16 km) parade route to watch the Liverpool team travel through the city on an open-top bus with the <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1913273"">Premier League trophy.</a></p> <p>Liverpool last <a href=""https://www.dawn.com/news/1565346"">won</a> the league in 2020, ending a 30-year-wait, but fans were unable to celebrate due to lockdowns during the pandemic. Police said the car hit the spectators as the event was winding down. In the aftermath, a photographer saw emergency services carrying victims on stretchers and in their arms to nearby ambulances.</p> <p>One source told <em>MailOnline</em> that it looked like the driver panicked when he realised he was in the crowd and people started banging on his car. The driver, who was sounding his horn, reversed and then accelerated forwards, according to reports from other witnesses.</p> <p>Police were unusually quick to provide a description of the man they arrested, saying around two hours after the incident he was a  53-year-old white British man from the Liverpool area.  Former police officers and local politicians said that statement was needed to cool social media speculation that the episode was an Islamist attack.</p> <p> That was one of my first concerns, that we needed to get the story out quickly,  Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram told the <em>BBC</em>.  If there s a vacuum, we know there are some elements that will try to inflame the situation and to create that speculation and to put misinformation out there. </p> <p><em>Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025</em></p>",https://www.dawn.com/news/1913791/over-50-injured-after-car-ploughs-into-liverpool-parade,en

Pakistan,Dawn,A war without end,2025-05-28 10:31:12,"<p>SUCCESSFUL defence against India s unwarranted aggression is certainly a great accomplishment and a matter of pride for the nation and the security forces. Yet a victory celebration in an ongoing conflict seems premature. The exchange of missiles and drones may have stopped, but the tension between the two countries is far from over. In the words of the Indian prime minister, it s just a  pause . It s an extremely dangerous situation that needs caution and not triumphalism.</p> <p>Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif s comment that Pakistan has taken revenge for the 1971 war seems highly questionable. Is there really any comparison between a war that led to the disintegration of the country and defeating the recent Indian attack? The 1971 tragedy was more than India s military invasion; it was also a war within that we as a nation must never forget. The tragedy is etched in our conscience.</p> <p>Attempts to politicise national security must also be avoided. The Indian aggression has united the country across the political spectrum. Political parties set aside their differences and stood behind the armed forces. But soon after the hostilities eased the daggers were out again, not realising the serious challenges the nation s security continues to confront. The major responsibility obviously lies with the government to bring down the political temperature as the threat of another Indian escalation looms large. A politically divided country weakens the country s defence.</p> <p>Then there is also a question about the elevation of the army chief to field marshal and the extension in the air force chief s tenure. Undoubtedly all the three forces did remarkably well in thwarting the Indian attack. The air force particularly played the most critical role not only in defending our airspace but also downing several Indian aircraft. It re-established Pakistan s deterrence even in the conventional field. There is also no doubting of the leadership of the army chief.</p> <blockquote class=""blockquote-level-1""> <p>Most troubling for India has been the strengthening of China-Pakistan defence collaboration.</p> </blockquote> <p>Still, it s difficult to understand the need to promote the army chief to the highest position just on the basis of four days of conflict. It was certainly not winning an all-out war. Gen Munir is the second military chief to be promoted to the five-star rank after Ayub Khan, the country s first military dictator.</p> <p>While giving full marks to the professional capabilities of our armed forces in taking on a much more powerful adversary, there is also a need to do a critical assessment of our vulnerabilities. It must be a cause for concern that the Indian missiles managed to hit some of our key airbases, including Nur Khan Airbase close to the capital. Surely the damage was not as much as being claimed by the Indian prime minister. Nevertheless, these gaps have to be plugged, as another Indian military strike seems very much on the cards.</p> <p>The four-day military face-off that drove the two nuclear-armed neighbours close to a full-blown war also brought to the fore the fast-shifting regional and global geopolitics. India s expectation of winning international approval for its military operation against Pakistan in response to the terrorist attack at a tourist spot in disputed territory failed miserably. Perhaps the most shocking development for the Modi government was President Trump s claim to have brokered the ceasefire using trade as leverage.</p> <p>One of the reasons for India s failure to muster support for its military action even from its strategic allies in the West was that it failed to provide any solid evidence of Pakistan s alleged involvement in the Pahalgam terrorist attack. India mostly relied on past incidents that allegedly had links to local militant groups. Israel was perhaps the only country which publicly backed India s military action against Pakistan.</p> <p>Another plausible reason for the US and other Western countries to counsel restraint to both states was the fear of the conflict turning into a nuclear confrontation; this would have had disastrous consequences for global peace. The Modi government in its hubris completely miscalculated India s strategic and economic importance. But it will be a mistake to read too much into Trump s offer to mediate between the two countries on Kashmir and other outstanding issues. No external mediation will be accepted by New Delhi. Moreover, India remains a strategic ally of the US despite the friction between the two countries on trade and tariffs issues. But there is certainly an opportunity for Pakistan to reset its relations with Washington.</p> <p>Most troubling for India, however, has been the strengthening of China-Pakistan defence collaboration. Pakistan s spectacular success in air warfare is largely the result of our strategic alliance with China. Besides close cooperation between the two air forces, the China-Pakistan naval axis is also visible.</p> <p>Pakistan and China both share security, military, and financial concerns. Advancing and reinforcing conventional and strategic relations with China is an essential component of Pakistan s foreign and national security policies. Beijing, however, would not like the conflict between its two nuclear-armed neighbours to escalate. Surely any fresh flare-up between India and Pakistan will have serious implications for the entire region and beyond.</p> <p>It now seems that the battlefront has moved to the field of diplomacy with both countries sending teams to various capitals to explain their respective positions on the sources of conflict. It s obvious that both sides will be raising the issue of terrorism apparently being used against each other as a tool in the ongoing covert war. But there are limits to what the international community can do in bringing the two countries together on the negotiating table. Both sides have now declared victory in a conflict that has resolved nothing. It s a war without an end.</p> <p><em>The writer is an author and journalist.</em></p> <p><strong><a href=""mailto:zhussain100@yahoo.com"">zhussain100@yahoo.com</a></strong></p> <p><strong>X: <a class=""link--external"" href=""https://x.com/hidhussain"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">@hidhussain</a></strong></p> <p><em>Published in Dawn, May 28th, 2025</em></p>",https://www.dawn.com/news/1913819/a-war-without-end,en
